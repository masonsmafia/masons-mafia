                    <p class="snippet">My name is Tom Ruff. I am a Front-End Web Developer and am currently in school
                        for Full-Stack web development at the University of Utah in Salt lake City. I am from Chicago
                        and moved to SLC in 2018 when I started working as a graphic designer for Hightech Signs. I
                        have a passion for building things; from working with wood or metal to designing software and
                        content on a computer. I love that I can use my creativity to design what I or another would
                        like to see come to life.
                        Full-Stack web development is where I want to be; I am constantly learning new material and
                        love challenging myself in new ways of building with code. Please have a look around and
                        connect with me if you are interested in my work! </p>
