                    <h2 class="title">December 26th, 2019</h2>
                    <p class="snippet">During the fall of 2019 Mason spent quite a bit of time home from school with
                        various illnesses. Many visits to the urgent care confirmed he had the common virus and it would
                        soon run its course.
                        Thanksgiving 2019, was a new experience. I hosted it at my house and Mason quietly kept to
                        himself. Nothing too out of the ordinary.
                        Christmas 2019 approached and Mason was ill again. A quick visit to Urgent Care confirmed
                        another virus.
                        Christmas Eve Mason and I made a quick last minute trip to pick out the gifts for his sisters.
                        He was strangely out of breath and wanted to ride in a cart. Since it was Christmas Eve and
                        chaotic there weren’t any carts available. He made his way through the jewelry and picked out
                        their gifts and was ready to go home.
                        He had always loved to be out and always asked to look at the toys. This time he didn’t ask to
                        even venture to that section.
                        We made our way home and he fell asleep on the couch. That was out of character but he had been
                        sick and was most likely overwhelmed. But his color, he was a strange color. Something I had
                        never seen before. But again he had a virus recently and maybe needed some nutrients.
                        The next morning was Christmas. We opened gifts and Mason participated as usual. He got a bike
                        from Santa and was so eager to ride it. He climbed up on the seat but couldn’t muster the
                        strength to turn the peddles. This bike wasn’t too big, it will likely be too small, soon but he
                        loved it!!! Feeling defeated he parked his bike and tried to walk to the couch. Now all the Mom
                        alarms are blaring!
                        HIS COLOR
                        HIS ENERGY LEVEL
                        Something isn’t right.
                        I talked with my Aunt, Chrissy and told her my concerns. She was concerned and mentioned how
                        often he had been sick since October.
                        That night I didn’t sleep at all. I watched him sleep. Counting his breaths.
                        December 26, 2019. After getting the ok from work;I pack him up and we arrive at the U of U ER.
                        They drew blood, and more and more people flooded his room.
                        Whispers and concern flooded his tiny ER room.
                        My little boy. I knew something wasn’t right.
                        PANIC
                        PANIC
                        PANIC
                        HOLD IT TOGETHER
                        YOU CANT LOSE IT
                        HES WATCHING YOU
                        PANIC
                        Then In what seemed like a split second I heard
                        “Your son has cancer, I’m not sure if it’s lymphoma or Leukemia, but it’s cancer”
                        My heart sank and my head began to spin...</p>
